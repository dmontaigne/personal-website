        <h1>Next Chapter</h1>

        <p>
            This page outlines what I’m looking for in my next full-time role.
            If something here sparks a connection to a team, company, or
            opportunity, I’d appreciate an introduction.
        </p>

        <p>
            For introductions that lead to a signed full-time offer, I’m
            offering a <strong>$1,000 AUD referral thank-you</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm also open to limited contracting, advisory conversations, or
            informal catch-ups where there's mutual curiosity.
        </p>

        <h2>What I'm looking for</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Senior product leadership roles (e.g., Head of Product, Lead,
                Principal). Title matters less than scope and ownership.
            </li>

            <li>
                Open to non-traditional, product-centred roles, such as
                product-focused Chief of Staff or Product GM.
            </li>

            <li>
                Clear responsibility for shaping strategy, discovery, and
                delivery outcomes.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I’m excited to build</h2>

        <p>
            I'm motivated by joining talented, driven teams taking on
            challenging missions. More than any specific company size, product
            category, or industry, what matters to me is the quality of the
            team, the ambition of the work, and the opportunity to build
            something meaningful together.
        </p>

        <h4>On size and stage:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I'm most interested in companies that are beyond the earliest
                pre-PMF phase and have real traction. This could be a more
                mature startup, or a larger organization running a focused
                internal venture or special projects team with genuine autonomy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>On the type of products:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I'm drawn to platforms, systems, and products with real
                operational depth, where systems thinking is required and
                product decisions involve real trade-offs.
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm also interested in teams exploring AI either as a core part
                of the product, or integrating it into features, tooling, and
                internal workflows in ways that meaningfully expand what the
                product can do.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>On industries:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>B2B software and platform businesses</li>
            <li>Defense and security-adjacent organizations</li>
            <li>
                AI and/or deep-tech research labs that are serious about turning
                advanced technical work into real products
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How I add value</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Shaping product and business direction early, particularly in
                B2B or platform-based organizations, with a design-led and
                commercially grounded perspective
            </li>
            <li>
                Framing ambiguous or complex problems and translating them into
                clear, actionable direction
            </li>
            <li>
                Aligning cross-functional stakeholders around shared narratives,
                priorities, and tradeoffs
            </li>
            <li>
                Turning complex systems into products and workflows that make
                sense to users and the business
            </li>
        </ul>
